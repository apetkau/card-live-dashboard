# 0.2.0
* Mapping region **Antarctica** to **N/A** if the date is before *2020-07-20*. This is because before that date CARD:Live defaulted to **Antarctica** (instead of no selected region) and so there were many results showing up as Antarctica when it was likely intended these should be N/A.
* Added an organism select dropdown for both LMAT and RGI Kmer results.

# 0.1.0

* First release of CARD:Live dashboard.
